# Udacity_Write_Data_Science_Post
The data from Seattle and Boston AirBNB homes can be used to understand how much AirBNB homes are earning in certain time frames and areas. You can compare rates between the two cities, or try to understand if there is anything about the properties that helps you predict price.

2. Motivation for the project
Airbnb is a online platform for lodging, which profits by receiving commission from each booking. We will review the data of Airbnb in Boston to learn more about the type of rooms and properties, the price and the correlation between price and reviews

Key Questions:
- Types of properties and room types
- The implication of different months on the room availaility and average price
- The correlation between price and reviews
